# Data Analytics Customer Segmentation

## Goal of the project
This project aims to perform a customer segmentation analysis for an automobile bike company using a RFM model. RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a behavior-based approach that groups customers into segments based on their previous purchase transactions. The analysis will divide the customer base into 11 groups, which will help determine the target customer segments that can be prioritized to boost the company's sales revenue.. A <b>Sales Dashboard for Customer Segmentation</b> is developed using <b>Tableau</b> and the data quality assessment and analysis is done using <b>Python</b>.
